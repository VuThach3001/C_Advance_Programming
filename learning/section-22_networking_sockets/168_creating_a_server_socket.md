### Notes Section (Main Notes)

**1. Steps in using sockets to communicate**
• create a new socket for network communication
• attach a local address to a socket (bind)
• announce willingness to accept connections (listen)
• block caller until a connection request arrives (accept)
• actively attempt to establish a connection (connect)
• send some data over connection (send)
• receive some data over connection (receive)
• release the connection (close)

**2. Steps specifically for a server socket**
•the steps involved in establishing a socket on the server side are as follows
•create a socket with the socket() system call
•bind the socket to an address using the bind() system call
•for a server socket on the Internet, an address consists of a port number on the host
machine
•listen for connections with the listen() system call
•accept a connection with the accept() system call
•typically blocks the connection until a client connects with the server
•send and receive data using the read()/recv and write()/send system calls

**4. simple server steps (pseudocode)**
```
my_sd = socket( )
bind( my_sd, <local address, mainly a port number> )
listen( my_sd )
start loop
his_sd = accept( my_sd, <empty address to be filled in with his incoming info> )
recv( his_sd, <where to put what you receive> )
send( his_sd, <the stuff you want sent> )
close( my_sd )
end loop
```
