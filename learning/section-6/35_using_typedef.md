**1. Overview**
- The `typedef` keyword is an advanced feature in C that enables you to create your own name for an existing data type
- To define a new type name with `typedef`
  - Write the statement as if a variable of the desired type were being declared
  - Where the name of the declared variable would normally appear, substitute the new type name
  - In front of everything, place the keyword `typedef`
```c
typedef int Counter;
```
- Defines the name Counter to be equivalent to the C data type `int`
- Variables can subsequently be declared to be of type `Counter`
```c
Counter j, n;
```
- The C compiler treats the declaration of the variables `j` and `n` as normal integer variables

**2. Advantages**
- One advantage is in the added readability that it lends to the definition of the variables
  - Code is more readable when the names of the types lend insight into the meaning and intended use of a type
  - It is clear from the definition of what the intended purpose of certain variables are in the program
- Another advantage is maintainability
  - Using typedef‘s instead of explicit types is analogous to using variables instead of explicit numbers (magic numbers)
  - If the type used for a certain purpose needs to be changed, then only the typedef line needs to be changed
    - When typedef’s are not used, thousands of manual changes to the code may be required to achieve this simple logical operation
- You can also use typedef to help make a program more portable
  - Used to create synonyms for the basic data types
- A program requiring 4-byte integers may use type int on one system and type long on another
- Programs designed for portability often use typedef to create an alias for 4-byte integers, such as Integer
  - The alias Integer can be changed once in the program to make the program work on both systems
